# Parallel Rails

A music game about infinite parallel rails, written by Pixi.js.

It's just a project for practice, all musics and pictures don't belong to me.

## Build and run

```text
$ yarn install
$ yarn run build
```

Then open `http://localhost/game/index.html` in your browser. `localhost` can be any other domain you set.
